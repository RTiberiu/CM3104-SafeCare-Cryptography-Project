Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. If you chew them, they taste bitter.

The liquid comes with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.
